## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I will periodically update this page with new projects to showcase my abilities to work with various technologies, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student, in my capstone course, at Southern New Hampshire University. I am focusing my efforts to earning a Software Engineering position when I transition out of the Navy in July.

## Code Review

## Code Snippets

As I decide on snippets to add to my page, I will showcase them here.

## Projects

### [Raspberry Pi Python with GrovePi HAT Simple Weather Station](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Raspberry-Pi-Weather-Station)

This repositroy contains a simple weather station application, written in Python for the Raspberry Pi with a GrovePi Hat and uses the Open Weather API.
Using data from Open Weather API calls, it updates a LCD display and lights different combinations of LEDs to show the user what 
temperature, humidity, and type of weather to expect.

### [C++ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-cpp)

This repository showcases working with binary search trees and trie data structures.
