## About Me

When I made the decision to leave the U.S. Navy nuclear program after eleven years, I decided to get a degree while I was on my last shore duty and learn something new. I love learning new things, which drew me to computer science. I was unfamiliar with the field but I could see it was constantly changing and growing. Which is why I felt a need to be a part of it.

After graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science, I accepted a position with Boeing as a Software Engineer on their Virtual Maintenance Trainer team. This was a fun and exciting project, building what was essentially a video game being used to train technicians how to perform maintenance on various aircrafts. My previous experience as a nuclear operator played a much larger role in my successes with Boeing than I originally thought it would. While this experience did not help me write better code, it did help me in performing thorough code reviews, and understanding how the aircrafts electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic systems would behave in the real world, which I could translate into the code to make the virtual aircraft behave similarly.

I now work as a Simulation Consultant, for MOSIMTEC LLC. In this role I wear a lot of different hats, which helps to satisfy my curiousity in learning new topics. I create simulation models for clients to help answer business questions that would otherwise require experimentation with real life systems. In this role I mostly code in Java, within Anylogic simulation software, and provide data analysis using data exported from the simulation models I build.

## Continuous Learning

### [C++ Udemy Course](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Udemy-Cpp-Course)

In this repository (linked above) I have been adding the section challenges as I complete them and writing about what I learned in each one. I did take a break from this while transitioning jobs, but have recently started back with it. I'm happy I chose to go back to this course, as I'm really learning a lot about C++. I originally decided to start this course during my year at Boeing, while I was working mostly with C++ and enjoyed working with this language. However, I knew there was a lot more to learn than what I was currently working on.

In conjuction with this course I'm also reading through *The C++ Programming Language Fourth Edition* by Bjarne Stroustrup and *Parallel and Distributed Programming Using C++* by Cameron and Tracey Hughes, to further my understanding of the language and all its quirks.
