## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I will periodically update this page with new projects to showcase my abilities to work with various technologies, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

## About Me
When I made the decision to transition out of the Navy nuclear program after eleven years, I decided to get a degree while I was on my last shore duty and learn something new. I love learning new things, which drew me to computer science. I was unfamiliar with the field but I could see it was constantly changing and growing. I had to be a part of it. I ended up graduating _cumma sum laude_ with a B.S. in Computer Science. I learned a lot throuhghout the program but most importantly realized I would never stop learning as long as I stay in the field. I couldn't be happier, knowing this. I have an insatiable thirst to continue learning new things or improving my understanding of technologies.

Recently I worked as a software engineer with Boeing in Jacksonville, FL. Where I mostly programmed in C++ and am interested in diving deeper into this language and using it to explore new side projects in robotics, machine learning, and IoT.

I now work as a Simulation Consultant, for MOSIMTEC LLC. In this role I wear a lot of different hats, which really satisfies my curiousity in learning new topics. I create simulation models for clients to help answer business questions that would otherwise require experimentation with real life systems. In this role I mostly code in Java, within Anylogic simulation software.

## Continuous Learning

### [C++ Udemy Course](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Udemy-Cpp-Course)
I chose to start going through this course during my year at Boeing. I was working with C++ a lot, and enjoyed working with this language. However, I knew there was a lot more to learn about C++ than what I was currently working on. Going through this course has been teaching me a lot, while also providing a great refresher on what I already knew. This course has also showed me how little I really knew about C++, especially around memory management and proper use of pointers. I am still working through this course, even though most of my time at work is spent coding in Java.
