## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I will periodically update this page with new projects to showcase my abilities to work with various technologies, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

## About Me
When I made the decision to transition out of the Navy nuclear program after eleven years, I decided to get a degree while I was on my last shore duty and learn something new. I love learning new things, which drew me to computer science. I was unfamiliar with the field but I could see it was constantly changing and growing. I had to be a part of it. I ended up graduating _cumma sum laude_ with a B.S. in Computer Science. I learned a lot throuhghout the program but most importantly realized I would never stop learning as long as I stay in the field. I couldn't be happier, knowing this. I have an insatiable thirst to continue learning new things or improving my understanding of technologies.

Currently I work as a software engineer with Boeing in Jacksonville, FL. I mostly program in C++ and am firstly interested in diving deeper into this language and using it to explore new side projects in robotics, machine learning, and IoT. My first project (besides school projects already posted) I plan on working on is an secondary Ecobee thermostat. I will post a link to the Git repo and periodic updates. My Github will also feature my continuous learning path and documentation on courses I take through Coursera, or similar platforms.

## School Projects

### [Raspberry Pi Python with GrovePi HAT Simple Weather Station](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Raspberry-Pi-Weather-Station)
In this artifact, I have a simple mock weather station. It was created to act like a weather station that would collect data and write to a json file for use in a dashboard. This was made during my Emerging Technologies course, which focused on embedded software and the IoT.

### [C++ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-cpp)
The artifact(s) I worked with for this project was a binary search tree (BST) project, that had functionality to insert nodes, remove them, search, and perform an in-order traversal. I wanted to add another data structure to showcase skills working with other data structures and the ability to pick up on new data structures and the algorithms to use with them. For this, I made a new project, working with tries.

### [C# CRUD Operations on MongoDB Golf Course Collection](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/MongoDB-CRUD-Csharp)
The artifact I worked with this week was a MongoDB CRUD API in Python. It was working with an established NoSQL database, that we had wrote code to perform the CRUD operations on, in a limited scope.

I chose this artifact because NoSQL databases are one of the emerging trends that I’ve noticed in the computer science field. I started noticing this pop up in job requirements as I was searching for jobs in my new career field. It’s important to be familiar with a broad field of technologies, maybe not so much early in a career, but definitely as you get more senior in your field. I wanted to go back and try this in a different language, because as much as I enjoy working in Python, I need to get more comfortable with other languages.
