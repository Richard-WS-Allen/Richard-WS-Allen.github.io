## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I will periodically update this page with new projects to showcase my abilities to work with various technologies, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student, in my capstone course, at Southern New Hampshire University. I am focusing my efforts to earning a Software Engineering position when I transition out of the Navy in July.
