## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I will periodically update this page with new projects to showcase my abilities to work with various technologies, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

## About Me
When I made the decision to transition out of the Navy nuclear program after eleven years, I decided to get a degree while I was on my last shore duty and learn something new. I love learning new things, which drew me to computer science. I was unfamiliar with the field but I could see it was constantly changing and growing. I had to be a part of it. I ended up graduating _cumma sum laude_ with a B.S. in Computer Science. I learned a lot throuhghout the program but most importantly realized I would never stop learning as long as I stay in the field. I couldn't be happier, knowing this. I have an insatiable thirst to continue learning new things or improving my understanding of technologies.

Recently I worked as a software engineer with Boeing in Jacksonville, FL. Where I mostly programmed in C++ and am interested in diving deeper into this language and using it to explore new side projects in robotics, machine learning, and IoT.

I now work as a Simulation Consultant, for MOSIMTEC LLC. In this role I where a lot of different hats, which really satisfies my curiousity in learning new topics. I create simulation models for clients to help answer business questions that would otherwise require experimentation with real life systems. Our work allows them to gain insights through the use of a simulation. In this role I mostly code in Java, within Anylogic simulation software.

## Side Projects

### [Alternate Ecobee Thermostat (work in progress)](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/EcobeeThermostat)
In this project, I was working on setting up a RaspberryPi, with a dial and LCD screen to display temperature and set temperatures for my Ecobee thermostat. I have taken a break from this project for the time being, although it was nearly completed. I wanted to go back through an in depth C++ course to do a deeper dive into a single language before starting too many other side projects, as I was starting to do.

## Continuous Learning

### [C++ Udemy Course](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Udemy-Cpp-Course)

## School Projects - no longer being updated, from 2019-2020

### [Raspberry Pi Python with GrovePi HAT Simple Weather Station](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Raspberry-Pi-Weather-Station)
In this artifact, I have a simple mock weather station. It was created to act like a weather station that would collect data and write to a json file for use in a dashboard. This was made during my Emerging Technologies course, which focused on embedded software and the IoT.

### [C++ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-cpp)
The artifact(s) I worked with for this project was a binary search tree (BST) project, that had functionality to insert nodes, remove them, search, and perform an in-order traversal. I wanted to add another data structure to showcase skills working with other data structures and the ability to pick up on new data structures and the algorithms to use with them. For this, I made a new project, working with tries.

### [C# CRUD Operations on MongoDB Golf Course Collection](https://github.com/Richard-WS-Allen/MongoDB-CRUD-Csharp)
The artifact I worked with this week was a MongoDB CRUD API in Python. It was working with an established NoSQL database, that we had wrote code to perform the CRUD operations on, in a limited scope.

I chose this artifact because NoSQL databases are one of the emerging trends that I’ve noticed in the computer science field. I started noticing this pop up in job requirements as I was searching for jobs in my new career field. It’s important to be familiar with a broad field of technologies, maybe not so much early in a career, but definitely as you get more senior in your field. I wanted to go back and try this in a different language, because as much as I enjoy working in Python, I need to get more comfortable with other languages.
